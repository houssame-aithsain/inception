<h1>Inception_42_project:</h1>
This project aims to familiarize you with Docker and its functionality, elucidating how Docker addresses one of the biggest challenges in the industry. Additionally, it will highlight the differences between Docker and virtual machines,
The project also includes creating your own Docker image and setting up the environment to facilitate communication between containers.
<h1>What is docker?:</h1>
Docker is a popular platform used for developing, shipping, and running applications. It allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a "container." These containers can then be easily moved between environments, such as from a developer's laptop to a production server, without worrying about differences in the underlying infrastructure.
<h1>What is container</h1>
A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that contains everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.
<h1>What is Virtual Machine</h1>
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications. It enables you to run multiple operating systems and applications on a single physical machine, known as the host, by creating isolated environments called virtual machines.
