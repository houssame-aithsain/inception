<h1>Inception</h1>
<p>
    The Inception project is designed to enhance and solidify understanding of Docker, a powerful platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. This project encompasses a comprehensive approach, starting from the foundational knowledge of Docker to the practical application of its features. The containers in this project will specifically include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Nginx</strong>: A high-performance web server that will serve as a reverse proxy and load balancer.</li>
    <li><strong>WordPress</strong>: A popular content management system (CMS) for building and managing websites.</li>
    <li><strong>MariaDB</strong>: An open-source database management system that will store the data for the WordPress instance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Knowledge Acquisition</strong>: Collect and study a variety of resources related to Docker, including documentation, tutorials, and best practices.</li>
    <li><strong>Environment Setup</strong>: Set up a robust Docker environment tailored to the projectâ€™s needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Container Synchronization</strong>: Create synchronized containers that host different services, ensuring effective communication between them over a Docker network.</li>
    <li><strong>Final Delivery</strong>: Enable the seamless delivery of the final application result to the browser.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<p>To successfully complete this project, a deep understanding of the following concepts is essential:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Docker Architecture</strong>: Familiarize yourself with the overall architecture of Docker, including its components and how they interact.</li>
    <li><strong>Namespaces</strong>: Learn about namespaces, which provide isolation for containers, ensuring that processes do not interfere with one another.</li>
    <li><strong>Docker Networks</strong>: Explore the different networking options available in Docker, allowing containers to communicate effectively while maintaining security and performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Docker Images</strong>: Understand the process of creating Docker images, which are templates used to create containers, and how to manage them.</li>
    <li><strong>Containers</strong>: Gain practical experience in managing containers, including starting, stopping, and linking them together to form a cohesive application.</li>
</ul>
